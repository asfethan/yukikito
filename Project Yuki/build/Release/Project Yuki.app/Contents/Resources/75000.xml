		<comment>The following is known as a sporadic event; this happens eventually on any day between 2011-10-20 and 2011-10-21.</comment>
		<narration>Takuya observes and sighs. He folds his language-book on itself. Yuki watches him.</narration>
		<line id="1000" speaker="yuki" voicelang="ja">What's up?</line>
		<line id="2000" speaker="takuya" voicelang="ja">I've fallen for a different-gender of different-landing.</line>
		<line id="3000" speaker="yuki" voicelang="ja">But I'm taken!</line>
		<line id="4000" speaker="takuya" voicelang="ja">Not you! What do I look like, a toddler-toucher?</line>
		<line id="5000" speaker="takuya" voicelang="ja">Look over there.</line>
		<narration><comment>Camera zoom out.</comment>Nestled in the alfresco seat of the half-bar is Lori Ciel.</narration>
		<line id="6000" speaker="takuya" voicelang="ja">I want her hand, but I doubt not that countless same-landed men have sought her.</line>
		<line id="7000" speaker="takuya" voicelang="ja">To her, I need to be someone new, someone unique&#x2014;</line>
		<narration>An airplane flies overhead &#x2014;</narration>
		<line id="8000" speaker="takuya" voicelang="ja">So I had at her tongue in hopes that I may have at her lips.</line>
		<line id="9000" speaker="yuki" voicelang="ja">Yeah.</line>
		<line id="10000" speaker="takuya" voicelang="ja">She looks most elegant.</line>
		<narration>The leaves of the freshly-planted half-bar trees rustle against one another. The wind turns Lori's hair aflame. She sips her chamomile and returns to the alien extermination game held in hand.<comment>Give the Player the illusion of inconsequentiality with the event; let her know she can can continue walking, but not that where and how she walks decides the outcome.</comment></narration>
