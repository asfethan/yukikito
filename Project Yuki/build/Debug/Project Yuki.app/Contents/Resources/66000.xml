		<narration>Club Sega, Akihabara. The outside of the club has wooden planks over it. Maintenance is expensive. We're in a recession. The inside of the club is inaccessible. Gamers sit at the sidewalk, playing Koshiro on harmonica. All are in long-skirt and newsboy-cap. Suzuki is sulking out front. He's holding a sign. It's in Kanji. Yuki looks at it.</narration>
		<line id="1000" speaker="yuki" voicelang="ja">What's the matter, Suzuki?</line>
		<narration>Suzuki sighs. He flips the sign, re-writes the sign in Hiragana, and holds the sign up.</narration>
		<line id="2000" speaker="game">Due to insufficient funds, all Sega arcade locations will close</line>
		<line id="3000" speaker="yuki" voicelang="ja">Oh.</line>
		<narration>Yuki sighs. She plops down on the sidewalk. An airplane flies overhead.</narration>
