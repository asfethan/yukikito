		<narration><comment>Zoom out.</comment>NoLifeQueen, satchmo_omega, and all the Japanese branch's employees pose on a cobbled street. NoLifeQueen looks around. She sees The Palais.</narration>
		<line id="12000" speaker="nolifequeen" voicelang="fr">This place &#x2014;</line>
		<narration>Thirty-foot tall shadow breaks the ground and comes up from the ground and smashes all of the things and flings all the things about. The shockwave deletes all but environment and administrator.</narration>

		<narration>The Shadow picks up the van and singlehandedly crushes it, leaving NoLifeQueen to run next to it on foot. Ganpu is out.</narration>
		<narration>The rest of the administrators run across the rooftops. The Shadow deletes one avatar after another, growing larger as it moves.</narration>
		<narration>And larger.</narration>
