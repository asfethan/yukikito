	<part>
		<narration>2008. Graduation day. Down to Earth floats in a single cap. Somebody catches it.</narration>
		<narration>Standing across the fence from that somebody is Yuki, holding her termination papers. She tears them apart and sheds a tear.</narration>
		<line id="900" speaker="yuki" voicelang="fr">I better catch the train.</line>
		<narration>Yuki begins the walk of shame.</narration>
		<narration>A Graduate from the class of 2008 calls out to her.</narration>
		<line id="1000" speaker="graduate" voicelang="fr">Hey!</line>
		<narration>Yuki looks back. She mutters under her breath.</narration>
		<line id="2000" speaker="yuki" voicelang="fr">Nobody here speaks French. This is a trap. Approach with great caution.</line>
		<narration>Yuki half-waves back..</narration>
		<line id="3000" speaker="yuki" voicelang="ja">Hello, good morning.</line>
		<narration>They walk down the street together.<comment>Graduate leads to the train station, Player follows.</comment></narration> 
		<line id="4000" speaker="graduate" voicelang="fr">But it's 5:00 PM.</line>
		<line id="5000" speaker="graduate" voicelang="fr">Old enough to drink, and you can't tell when it's happy hour? How do you survive?</line>
		<line id="6000" speaker="yuki" voicelang="fr">I don't drink as much as I did before college.</line>
		<line id="7000" speaker="yuki" voicelang="fr">Then again, I'm not really surviving, am I?</line>
		<line id="8000" speaker="graduate" voicelang="fr">What do you mean?</line>
		<line id="9000" speaker="yuki" voicelang="fr">I dropped out.</line>
		<line id="10000" speaker="yuki" voicelang="fr">My senior year's college fund&#x2014; that's all I had left to live on.</line>
		<line id="11000" speaker="graduate" voicelang="fr">So we're not in the same boat, here.</line>
		<line id="12000" speaker="graduate" voicelang="fr">So much for young and beautiful college grads outside the land of the rising sun.</line>
		<line id="13000" speaker="graduate" voicelang="fr">Just think! Us graduates, on an epic journey to find Pomme-friendly work&#x2014; but you're no graduate.</line>
		<line id="14000" speaker="graduate" voicelang="fr">Opportunity lost! Stay in school, fool. This economy is unkind to the unemployed.</line>
		<line id="15000" speaker="graduate" voicelang="fr">How are you going to make money after that fund runs out?</line>
		<line id="16000" speaker="yuki" voicelang="fr">I'll figure that out when mom stops sending me her residuals.</line>
		<line id="17000" speaker="graduate" voicelang="fr">What!</line>
		<line id="18000" speaker="graduate" voicelang="fr">Don't suck your parents dry, that's how people become NEET!</line>
		<line id="19000" speaker="yuki" voicelang="fr">NEET?</line>
		<line id="20000" speaker="graduate" voicelang="fr">Not in Education, Employment, or Training.</line>
		<line id="21000" speaker="graduate" voicelang="fr">Deadbeats. Losers. Otaku. Fujoshi. Nerds.</line>
		<line id="22000" speaker="graduate" voicelang="fr">People who wake up every morning and decide to jerk off to comic books instead of living their damn lives!</line>
		<line id="23000" speaker="graduate" voicelang="fr">They lock the doors, close the windows, stock up on crappy food,</line>
		<line id="24000" speaker="graduate" voicelang="fr">And take solace in throwing noodles in hot water, halfway making their bed, and sleeping for twelve hours.</line>
		<line id="25000" speaker="yuki" voicelang="fr">Oh.</line>
		<narration>The two continue their walk without another word. The sights and sounds of Tokyo exist. The Graduate's cellphone rings.</narration>
		<line id="26000" speaker="graduate" voicelang="ja">Hello?</line>
		<narration>The Graduate gives Yuki a thumbs-up and a grin. He covers the phone and to Yuki whispers:</narration>
		<line id="27000" speaker="graduate" voicelang="fr">It's the guys at tri-Ace, calling about my internship!</line>
		<narration>The Graduate listens to the phone, all the while nodding and smiling. Then, he frowns.</narration>
		<line id="28000" speaker="graduate" voicelang="ja">You're &#x2014; cutting the internship program? Too costly?</line>
		<line id="29000" speaker="graduate" voicelang="ja">Well, I mean, you don't have to pay me&#x2014;</line>
		<line id="30000" speaker="graduate" voicelang="ja">Restricting employment to citizens of Japanese heritage? You can do that?</line>
		<line id="31000" speaker="graduate" voicelang="ja">Nintendo policy?</line>
		<line id="32000" speaker="graduate" voicelang="ja">Wait, Nintendo?</line>
		<narration>A delay. The other end of the conversation's explaining something.</narration>
		<line id="33000" speaker="graduate" voicelang="ja">I see. Have a nice summer, sellouts.</line>
		<narration>The graduate throws the phone at the train tracks. He smiles.</narration>
		<line id="34000" speaker="graduate" voicelang="ja">There goes my internship.</line>
		<line id="35000" speaker="yuki" voicelang="ja">And here comes the train.</line>
		<narration>The Graduate storms past Yuki and onto the train. When Yuki gets on the train, she sees The Graduate at the door on the other side of the car. Shortly after, a group of Cap-and-Tassels board the train.<comment>This happens by default, and if the player attempts to move to the side of the train where The Graduate is, the people interrupt her by walking in quickly.</comment> The train starts.</narration>
		<line id="36000" speaker="graduate" voicelang="ja">Hey, it's you all!</line>
		<narration>The Cap-and-Tassels give the same reply, in different dialects.</narration>
		<line id="37000" speaker="caps" voicelang="ja">Hey man, what's up?</line>
		<line id="38000" speaker="graduate" voicelang="ja">Nothing much! So what are your plans for the future?</line>
		<line id="39000" speaker="caps" voicelang="ja">Work, in the grand old video game industry!</line>
		<line id="40000" speaker="graduate" voicelang="fr">Hey, Yuki. Come over here; this exit'll make it easier to get off the train.</line>
		<narration>Yuki begins to walk to the other side of the train car. The Cap-and-Tassels dream of the future.<comment>No dialogue progress until the player walks to the other side of the train.</comment></narration>
		<narration>A single Cap-and-Tassel clasps her hands together.</narration>
		<line id="41000" speaker="caps" voicelang="ja">I got accepted for employment... the big time! I can't wait until I can work on...</line>
		<narration>Yuki continues walking across the train car. Each of the Cap-and-Tassels holds a binder with a design document for a hit new video game.<comment>Written on the front of each binder is the game in question's series number, counting sequels, spinoffs, and remakes. These can be approximate, exactness isn't the point. Zoom in on Yuki. As Yuki passes a Cap-and-Tassel, that Cap-and-Tassel recites the game's marketing name. Vision text appears on the binder showing the series number of that game.</comment></narration>
