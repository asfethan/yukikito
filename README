Project Yuki - The Videogame about Videogames.

Main
======================
Project Yuki is a 2.5D real-time game industry simulation/tactical shooting game written in C++. It uses SVG for all of its graphics. The game is designed from the ground up to have a visually appealing, touch-friendly interface for tablet computers. 

Much of the game's interaction is based around its narrative, a satire of the modern video game industry. The game's voices are primarily in Japanese and French.
