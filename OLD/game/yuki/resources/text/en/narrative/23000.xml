		<narration>Droning are the beetles, half-asleep. In the fold-up bed of a deliberately unlit Tokyo apartment, head-in-sheets, lies Yuki. She pulls the blanket from her face and gasps for air. She mumbles a bit to herself.</narration>
		<line id="1000" speaker="yuki" voicelang="fr">We are but gods.</line>
		<line id="2000" speaker="yuki" voicelang="fr">We create worlds</line>

		<line id="11000" speaker="nozomi" voicelang="ja">Come, ladies and gentlemen! We have hopes and dreams to wash away.</line>
		<narration>The team sustains its rowdy cheers and makes their worthwhile trek to the land of social lubricants. Yuki follows.<comment>Sudden cut to the "Japanese Only" sign.</comment>Japanese Only. She looks up at the Muscles.</narration>

		<line id="14000" speaker="yuki" voicelang="ja">Is it because I'm French or is it because I'm not Japanese?</line>
		<line id="15000" speaker="suji" voicelang="ja">I don't make the rules, I just keep out the Pommes. And sometimes, the Koreans...</line>
