	<part>
		<narration>Around Yuki looms a crowd. They're all talking to each other, enjoying each other's company, having great conversation, winning at social interaction. Every attempt Yuki makes to approach a person ends in fear. Yuki whispers to herself.</narration>
		<line id="1000" speaker="yuki" voicelang="fr">I can't win at this.</line>
		<line id="2000" speaker="yuki" voicelang="fr">I'm a game designer, I shouldn't think of shallow terms like "win" and "lose."</line>
		<line id="3000" speaker="yuki" voicelang="fr">But I must play to win, play to win, play to win &#x2014;</line>
		<line id="4000" speaker="yuki" voicelang="fr">I will speak with a stranger!</line>
		<narration>Yuki makes her approach. Flames burst from the ground, surrounding her.<comment>Player cannot escape.</comment></narration>
		<narration>A lonely path opens throughout the flames. Yuki shivers.</narration>
		<line id="5000" speaker="yuki" voicelang="fr">If I touch the fire, I'll die.</line>
		<narration><comment>The player may attempt to walk Yuki to the flame, but it ends with her cowering.</comment>Yuki walks through the flame. At the very end &#x2014; Ganpu. Yuki keeps her distance. Ganpu leans forward.</narration>
		<narration>Ganpu places his palm to his forehead. From there, he covers an eye, fingers spawning a makeshift fringe. From there &#x2014; his fingers caresses his cheek. Yuki gasps. Yuki mirrors. Flames subside.</narration>
		<narration>Ganpu, palm still on forehead, tips his fingers upward. He flickers his fingers about. Yuki mirrors. She sighs.</narration>
		<line id="5000" speaker="ganpu" voicelang="ja">You're ridiculous.</line>
		<narration>Yuki drops to her knees.</narration>
		<line id="6000" speaker="yuki" voicelang="fr">I know.</line>
