		<narration>Yuki's new shirt calls exactly the sort of attention it wants. From the swarms of point-and-shoots emerge flashes of light. The so-called press showers attention on the blonde, french, female game designer.</narration>

		<line id="5000" speaker="game">Played a demo.</line>
		<narration>Yuki runs into another press-man.</narration>
		<line id="6000" speaker="game">Press Photographer appeared!</line>
		<line id="7000" speaker="game">Say Cheese!</line>
		<narration>Yuki finally makes it to the conference room.</narration>
		<line id="8000" speaker="game">Made it to the conference room.</line>
		<line id="9000" speaker="game">Both Ubisoft and Sega share this room.</line>
		<narration>Yuki looks around. The room is empty. She sighs.</narration>
		<line id="10000" speaker="yuki" voicelang="fr">Everyone else can stay out there. I'll just wait until the presentation.</line>
		<narration>Yuki paces around the room. It begins to fill up.<comment>Player can walk her around. As she walks normal speed, frequent sudden shift as the room populates.</comment> Yuki takes a seat.</narration>
		<narration>Ubisoft's presentation. A public relations representative paces across stage, sweating buckets.</narration>

		<line id="16000" speaker="yuki" voicelang="fr">Seems the Software Identity Act has laid its waste.</line>
		<narration>Next to her smirks a producer.</narration>
		<line id="17000" speaker="raymond" voicelang="fr">Yeah.</line>
		<line id="18000" speaker="raymond" voicelang="fr">Law has made Paris impotent. So they shove work on Shanghai and Montreal.</line>

		<line id="20000" speaker="raymond" voicelang="fr">By 2012, everything coming out of this French company will be Chinese.</line>
		<line id="21000" speaker="yuki" voielang="fr">So much for "identity," huh?</line>
		<narration>The two laugh. The producer notices Yuki's pen-and-paper.</narration>
		<line id="22000" speaker="raymond" voicelang="fr">What's that you're working on?</line>
		<narration>Yuki looks down.<comment>Urge player to get a good look at this.</comment></narration>

			</choice>
		</condition>
		<narration>Yuki leaves her seat. She finagles her way thorugh the seating arrangement. Hands slam hands. The applause echoes. And echoes. And echoes. She looks ahead. The stage-steps end abruptly, afterward an abyss. The wind howls.</narration>
		<line id="33000" speaker="raymond" voicelang="en">Come on Yuki, get up there &#x2014;</line>
		<narration>Yuki runs down the aisle and to the stage-steps. <comment>Ramp up sound, ramp up heartbeat.</comment>She leaps.</narration>
		<narration>Yuki stands on air. The crowd goes silent. She turns to them. All stare ahead towards the blank screen and the blank woman, readied for first impression.<comment>Cut to far-away view encompassing Yuki and crowd.</comment>Yuki clears her throat.</narration>
		<line id="34000" speaker="yuki" voicelang="en">Games!</line>
		<narration>Yuki raises hands to the heavens, projecting personality without an amplifier. The presentation starts. The screen shows Sega's logo.<comment>Cut to close up of Yuki's face. Player doesn't get to see what's on that screen otherwise.</comment>Yuki turns to look.</narration>
		<narration>Yuki gasps. The crowd shivers. Hardened journalists salute. Softened ones go into shock. Designers pray. Producers stare. Raymond sheds a tear. Yuki whispers.</narration>
		<line id="35000" speaker="yuki" voicelang="fr">Oh my god.</line>
		<narration>Silence. Yuki, soft a-puff and hard a-pant, turns weak-legged to the crowd.</narration>
		<line id="36000" speaker="yuki" voicelang="en">That's &#x2014; that's the game.</line>
		<narration>Yuki exits, everyone staring at her walk.<comment>Player has to walk Yuki out, camera does not follow. Sudden cut.</comment></narration>
		<narration>Flash.</narration>
		<line id="37000" speaker="press" voicelang="en">Fantastic presentation!</line>
