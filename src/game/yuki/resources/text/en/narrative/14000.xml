		<narration>Nozomi points down the hallway in the direction of the studio Yuki now leads. Yuki walks. Nozomi spouts:</narration>

		<line id="6000" speaker="yuki" voicelang="fr">This is my company.</line>
		<narration>Yuki stands at the door. Eyes closed, smiling wide. She looks at it. She looks at Nozomi. She puts her hand on the knob. She pushes the door open.</narration>
		<narration>Battlefield. Misled software development. Document shrapnel. Segfault bullets. Exception artillery. Yelling. Screaming. Fear. Yuki takes a few steps and trips, her face landing near an old, decrepit binder. It's an application design document, like every other in the room.<comment>The first instance of a deprecated design document.</comment></narration>
		<line id="7000" speaker="yuki" voicelang="fr">What&#x2014;</line>
		<narration><comment>As in normal gameplay, the binder begins to beep. The Player has three seconds to have Yuki disperse.</comment></narration>

		<line id="11000" speaker="dan" voicelang="ja">Yes, throw away every single base class!</line>
		<line id="12000" speaker="dan" voicelang="ja">The sound library wrappers are incompatible with&#x2014;</line>
		<narration>In the distance, explosions. Dan Yoshizaki at them winces. A large man grabs him and fireman-carries him across.</narration>
		<line id="13000" speaker="dan" voicelang="ja">Leave me here!</line>
		<line id="14000" speaker="dan" voicelang="ja">I said leave me here, dammit!</line>

		<narration>Yuki raises her hand.</narration> 
		<line id="23000" speaker="yuki" voicelang="ja">Listen!</line>
		<line id="24000" speaker="yuki" voicelang="ja">So I am Sega's death.</line>

		<line id="26000" speaker="nozomi" voicelang="ja">I will follow you to the ends of the earth, Yuki!</line>
		<line id="26000" speaker="yuki" voicelang="ja">See? At least one of you has some damn sense.</line>
		<line id="27000" speaker="yuki" voicelang="ja">Alas, one artist does not a team make.</line>
		
		<line id="28000" speaker="yuki" voicelang="ja">Neither do either of any of you.</line>
