		<narration>2008. All is calm in the old-studio. Shimizu jumps up and down, laughing hard and grinning wide.</narration>
		<line id="1000" speaker="hanako" voicelang="ja">We're so close! Only two more days until we're finished with Phantasy Star 5!</line>
		<narration>Burst. Through the door. It's Jacques. There are breadcrumbs caught in his beard. He's wearing yesterday's shirt. In his hands is a scratched-and-beaten laptop. He power-walks past Shimizu and Takuya.</narration>
		<line id="2000" speaker="takuya" voicelang="ja">His eyes!</line>
		<line id="3000" speaker="takuya" voicelang="ja">I know that look.</line>
		<line id="4000" speaker="takuya" voicelang="ja">I know those hands.</line>
		<line id="5000" speaker="takuya" voicelang="ja">Those are Miyamoto's hands! He's gonna flip the table!</line>
		<line id="6000" speaker="hanako" voicelang="ja">We must stop him!</line>
		<narration>Jacques stops. He yells one word:</narration>
		<line id="7000" speaker="jacques" voicelang="ja">Nozomi!</line>
		<narration>Nozomi jumps through the door. She points at Shimizu.<comment>Interface style change. Nozomi is Leading Character. She follows Jacques.</comment></narration>
		<line id="8000" speaker="nozomi" voicelang="ja">Don't move.</line>
		<narration>Nozomi begins to bark orders.</narration>
		<line id="9000" speaker="nozomi" voicelang="ja">Nobody move! This is a commit! Keep to yourselves! Go on!</line>
		<narration><comment>Player control Nozomi following Jacques through the studio.</comment>Jacques walks into the table room. He places the laptop on the floor. He puts his arms under the table. He flings it. The table's top slams hard against the ground. Jacques leaves the table room. Nozomi follows.</narration>
		<narration>Jacques runs into the server room. Nozomi locks and bars the door to shield she and Jacque from the bangs and rattles on the other side.</narration>
		<line id="9100" speaker="suzuki" voicelang="ja">Jacques, open up! This is stupid!</line>
		<line id="9200" speaker="naka" voicelang="ja">Jacques, you bastard! People like you are why I left Sega!</line>
		<line id="9300" speaker="kodama" voicelang="ja">Jacques, you're disappointing everyone.</line>
		<line id="9400" speaker="takuya" voicelang="ja">Jacques, mark my words: I will have No Clich√© shut down.</line>
		<line id="9500" speaker="jacques" voicelang="fr">This is it.</line>
		<line id="10000" speaker="jacques" voicelang="fr">This is the only source code repository for Phantasy Star 5.</line>
		<narration>Jacques takes out a laptop.</narration>
		<line id="11000" speaker="jacques" voicelang="fr">Once I press this button, nobody will be able to revert to a backup.</line>
		<narration>Jacques presses this button.</narration>
		<line id="12000" speaker="jacques" voicelang="fr">Once I press this button, my experimental source code will be added.</line>
		<narration>Jacques presses this button. Nozomi sweats and pants.</narration>
		<line id="13000" speaker="jacques" voicelang="fr">Once I press this button, this game will no longer be known as Phantasy Star 5.</line>
		<narration>Jacques presses this button. Nozomi drops down next to Jacques. Every server's fans blast at full speed and yet, plastics still melt. Lightbulbs burst. Nozomi fans herself.<comment>Main Action is fanning.</comment></narration>
		<line id="14000" speaker="nozomi" voicelang="ja">Jacques &#x2014; It's hot.</line>
		<line id="14100" speaker="jacques" voicelang="ja">Server rooms usually are.</line>
		<line id="15000" speaker="nozomi" voicelang="ja">Jacques &#x2014; this is ridiculous.</line>
		<line id="16000" speaker="jacques" voicelang="fr">Apologies usually are.</line>
		<line id="17000" speaker="nozomi" voicelang="ja">So if this game is no longer Phantasy Star 5, what is it?</line>
		<narration>Jacques looks to the heavens. Then, he looks to his palm.</narration>
		<line id="18000" speaker="jacques" voicelang="fr">The Clan.</line>
