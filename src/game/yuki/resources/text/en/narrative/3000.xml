		<narration lineid="">In the commons room sit Yuki's parents. Asami, curled on a wheeled chair, seats a-crescent, strumming. Jacques reads a newspaper. Enter Yuki.<comment>Yuki runs into the view of the camera again, and the player reassumes control.</comment></narration>
		<narration lineid="">Yuki takes a deep breath, looks her mother in the eyes, and speaks in second-tongue:</narration>
		<line id="1000" voicelang="ja" speaker="yuki">Good night!</line>
		<narration lineid="">Asami looks out of the window and into the sun.</narration>
		<line id="2000" voicelang="fr" speaker="asami">What a fine night this is.</line>
		<narration lineid="">Yuki frowns.</narration>
		<line id="3000" voicelang="fr" speaker="yuki">Is my Japanese still that terrible? I'm never right.</line>
		<narration lineid="">Asami pats Yuki.</narration>
		<line id="4000" voicelang="fr" speaker="asami">Being right is only half the battle.</line>
		<line id="5000" voicelang="fr" speaker="asami">Remember that greatness knows not language nor country.</line>
		<narration>Asami relaxes, spine concave. Her neck parallels the tile. Yuki folds her arms.</narration>
		<line id="5100" voicelang="fr" speaker="yuki">Mom, you're sitting funny again.</line>
		<line id="5200" voicelang="fr" speaker="yuki">It's scary.</line>
		<narration>Asami frowns. Fleeting violent twitch. Calm. Breathing practice. Asami relaxes further, placing her feet on the tall table. She laughs?</narration>
		<line id="5300" voicelang="ja" speaker="asami">My condolences, little explorer. I need the moon to stay a fortnight.</line>
		<narration>Yuki pivots to her father. Father glares at the technology section. The headline reads:</narration>

		<line id="15000" speaker="jj" voicelang="fr">I finally mastered the Freebird solo on ukelele!</line>
		<line id="16000" speaker="asami" voicelang="fr">That's nice.</line>
		<narration lineid="">JJ's excitement fades&#x2014;</narration>
		<line id="17000" speaker="jacques" voicelang="fr">My son!</line>
		<narration lineid="">Jacques frolics to JJ and puts his hands on JJ's shoulders. JJ stands.</narration>

		<narration>Jacques nods, Jacques nods!</narration>
		<line id="21000" speaker="jj" voicelang="fr">So I put one at the end of the for statement!</line>
		<narration lineid="">Jacques face-palms.</narration>
		<line id="22000" speaker="jacques" voicelang="fr">Did you even read the book I gave you?</line>
		<line id="23000" speaker="jj" voicelang="fr">Well—</line>
		<line id="24000" speaker="jacques" voicelang="fr">No matter. Intelligence lies in the realm of experience.</line>
		<narration>JJ sighs.</narration>
		<line id="24100" speaker="jj" voicelang="fr">Well, what if I&#x2014;</line>
		<narration>Jacques heaves up the picket-sign. Yuki picks up her picket-sign. JJ looks up at it.</line>
		<line id="25000" speaker="jj" voicelang="fr">Oh no, are you going to do all of that yelling and screaming again?</line>
		<line id="26000" speaker="jacques" voicelang="fr">It's for a purpose.</line>
