		<narration><comment>Cut to church bell, ding four times leading into Get On It. After the fourth ding, start piano riff. NoLifeQueen appears on screen.</comment>NoLifeQueen flies past the church bell, through her dress the wind a-blowing.<comment>Impressment opportunity. Player hits the ground running. Camera does not follow NoLifeQueen on the way down. Cut to running.</comment></narration>
		<line id="1000" speaker="nolifequeen" voicelang="en">Yeah!</line>
		<narration>NoLifeQueen hits the ground running, Clan in tow. Something is amiss &#x2014; everyone's account passwords are showing directly under their usernames.<comment>Bass riff. Game controls camera for a bit.</comment>NoLifeQueen, Davis, and their Clans clamor down the cobbled street.<comment>And right at the beginning of the chorus, dolly out.</comment>Everyone's excited! This is going to be a great time!<comment>And then at the end of the bridge&#x2014;</comment>In rushes a bursting blast of blinding steam.</narration>
		<line id="2000" speaker="nolifequeen" voicelang="en">Everyone on the roof!</line>
		<narration>Not much better. Player names become garbled. Passwords disappear. Items become invisible. All is obscured from view but friend, foe, and ground. The steam rages on.<comment>Have the steam not be there for a few seconds when the player reaches the roof. Items should be present in the area, to show that they are not visible when the steam is around.</comment></narration>
		<line id="3000" speaker="nolifequeen" voicelang="en">What was that?</line>

		<line id="6000" speaker="davis" voicelang="en">We've got to keep the steam going!</line>
		<narration>The steam sporadically disappears, leaving sensitive information out in the open. IP Addresses, SSH public keys, passwords, email addresses &#x2014; a wrench falls from the sky.</narration>
		<line id="7000" speaker="davis" voicelang="en">Get that wrench and fix the valves!</line>
		<narration>NoLifeQueen reaches for the wrench and an opponent grabs it and runs off. NoLifeQueen chases him!<comment>This portion of the level is straightforward: the more fixed valves, the more users. To fix a valve, the player has to go up to one with the wrench and Fix as Main Action. This takes a while. To prevent the player from backtracking, the steam gets incredibly thick and deals damage the further back she goes.</comment></narration>
