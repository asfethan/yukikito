		<narration>Yuki searches the terminal. The kind in an airport. A man holds up a sign with Yuki's name in Kanji. Yuki walks past it several times. <comment>Don't pop-up a vision tooltip here.</comment>The man stares at her each time. He flips the sign, rewrites the sign in Katakana, and holds it up. <comment>The vision text appears.</comment></narration>

		<line id="6000" speaker="yuki" voicelang="en">No.</line>
		<narration>The clamor of cellphones, announcer-ettes, and distant jets resonates through the terminal. Two other guys are standing near davis.</narration>

		<narration>The friends ride through LA in a car, European.</narration>
		<line id="11000" speaker="davis" voicelang="en">So, Yuki, how's Japan?</line>
		<line id="12000" speaker="yuki" voicelang="en">Well, no-one can afford Gundams anymore. Everyone is broke.</line>

		<line id="18000" speaker="yuki" voicelang="en">Better than Ticonderoga?</line>
		<narration>It's hard to hear the crickets at night in Los Angeles. The room is pretty cozy. There is a small lamp on the night stand next to the one-woman bed.</line>
		<line id="19000" speaker="davis" voicelang="en">Well, we should leave the little lady to get some rest.</line>
		<line id="20000" speaker="davis" voicelang="en">After all, she has hundreds of demos to play tomorrow.</line>
		<line id="21000" speaker="davis" voicelang="en">And, at this E3,</line>
