		<narration>In lab-coat and pajama-pants, Yuki sits in the dark of her room. Her eyes seem more defined. She stares at her computer.</narration>

		<line id="6000" speaker="yuki" voicelang="fr">You know what that means, everyone.</line>
		<narration>What does it mean, Yuki? Yuki rubs her chin, thinking of an answer. She snaps her fingers. Eureka! She flails her arms around.</narration>
		<line id="7000" speaker="yuki" voicelang="fr">Recess!</line>
		<narration>Yuki thinks. She looks up to the sky.</narration>
		<line id="8000" speaker="yuki" voicelang="fr">Oh &#x2014; I mean, that other thing gamers like &#x2014; The Clan.</line>
		<line id="9000" speaker="jacques" voicelang="fr">The Clan.</line>
		<line id="10000" speaker="nozomi" voicelang="ja">It started with you.</line>
		<narration>Yuki shivers, holding her head.</narration>
		<line id="11000" speaker="yuki" voicelang="fr">It will end with me.</line>
		<narration>NoLifeQueen logs in.</narration>
		<narration>NoLifeQueen looks around. She gasps.</narration>
		<line id="12000" speaker="nolifequeen" voicelang="fr">Sophia Antipolis.</line>
		<narration><comment>Slow motion.</comment>A virtual-Jacques and a virtual-Asami in a virtual-Car drive down the virtual-Street, yelling in their virtual-Voices.</narration>
		<line id="13000" speaker="jacques" voicelang="fr">I hate film events! How else could every hospital near the Palais be closed?</line>

		<narration>The Scene upends. Then it flickers. Then it clips. Then some objects err. Then the car transforms into a shadowy figure and the shadowy figure disappears into the virtual-Night. NoLifeQueen looks at Yuki through the screen. She gives Yuki a thumbs-up.</narration>
		<line id="19000" speaker="nolifequeen" voicelang="fr">Here begins The Apology.</line>
		<narration>The Shadow upheaves two buildings from the ground and crushes them in its fingertips. The debris crushes the bushes. The debris crushes the light-posts. The debris crushes the fences. NoLifeQueen shouts at her controller.</narration>
		<line id="20000" speaker="nolifequeen" voicelang="fr">Yuki, we have to find shelter!</line>
		<narration>NoLifeQueen runs into a building.<comment>If the Player keeps her outside for too long, NoLifeQueen will be crushed.</comment></narration>
		<narration><comment>All of the buildings here have windows. All of the buildings here are interconnected. Player moves NoLifeQueen between them through windows and rooftops and fire escapes.</comment>The Shadow writhes in constant shift, punching and kicking through the windows, punching and kicking through the floors, punching and kicking through the roofs.</narration>
		<narration><comment>Player should have NoLifeQueen running for this.</comment>Half of the screen explodes into a shower of hex. The hex dissipates. Half of the land is now stark-white abyss. NoLifeQueen stops just before the edge of the cliff.</narration>
		<narration>The Shadow stands directly behind NoLifeQueen. She looks back. The shadow counts on its shifting warp-ed fingers three.<comment>Instill fear in the player. Don't tell them anything about the countdown. Just know the enemy is giving them three seconds.</comment></narration>
		<narration>Two.</narration>
		<narration>One.</narration>
		<narration>NoLifeQueen cringes. The abyss-blown wind flows through her hair. She looks up. She yawns. She scratches her head.<comment>The second the Player has NoLifeQueen perform any non-movement action,</comment>The Shadow pushes NoLifeQueen off the cliff. </narration>
		<narration>For a while, a free fall. Down, down, down. NoLifeQueen's legs fling to and fro, hitting the air &#x2014; then, more air &#x2014; then, something. A slope. 90 degrees.</narration>
		<narration>80 degrees. The Shadow is in miracle world. It slams down on the slope, and as it lags behind, it claws after NoLifeQueen.</narration>
		<narration>70 degrees. The Shadow is a space-man, shooting lasers at NoLifeQueen.</narration>
		<narration>60 degrees. The Shadow is a sweet soul brother, stomping at NoLifeQueen with roller skates.</narration>
		<narration>50 degrees. The Shadow is of the dead, snarling and gargling at NoLifeQueen.</narration>
		<narration>40 degrees. The Shadow is a blue rogue, swashbuckling about the hill, sword a-point at NoLifeQueen.</narration>
		<narration>30 degrees. The Shadow is a fashionable witch, dancing about, stomping at NoLifeQueen.</narration>
		<narration>20 degrees. The Shadow is a sorceress, dropping nuisances on NoLifeQueen.</narration>
		<narration>10 degrees. The Shadow is a star. He grabs at NoLifeQueen.</narration>
		<narration>0 degrees. The Shadow lags behind, eventually leaving sight. Silence. The ground under NoLifeQueen begins to break away.</narration>
		<narration>The Shadow is a Hedgehog. Past NoLifeQueen it speeds hundred-fold, leaving behind flames and hurling golden rings. 10 degrees. 20 degrees. 40 degrees. 80 degrees. 160 degrees. 320 degrees. 360 degrees. Launch.</narration>
		<narration>The Shadow and NoLifeQueen fly past hundreds of floating platforms. Every platform NoLifeQueen lands on explodes into hex. The Shadow spawns televisions on the screen and breaks each apart. With every broken television, The Shadow gains some sort of new shield. Energy. Electricity. Water. Fire. The Shadow lights NoLifeQueen ablaze. Her hit point-counter rolls to zero. Game Over.</narration>
		<narration>Yuki raises a bottle of vodka.</narration>
		<line id="22000" speaker="yuki" voicelang="fr">Some apology, Jacques.</line>
		<line id="23000" speaker="yuki" voicelang="fr">NoLifeQueen!</line>

		<line id="25000" speaker="yuki" voicelang="fr">What's happening to me?</line>
		<line id="26000" speaker="yuki" voicelang="fr">Since when could a video game make me feel?</line>
		<narration>Yuki looks up at the bottle.<comment>Then, she looks at the player.</comment></narration>
		<line id="27000" speaker="yuki" voicelang="fr">This bottle is empty.</line>
		<narration>Yuki sniffles.</narration>
		<line id="28000" speaker="yuki" voicelang="fr">I need more!</line>
