		<narration>Work is over. From her pocket, Yuki pulls the printed page in its creased and crumpled glory.<comment>Sudden cut to the practice hall.</comment></narration>
		<narration>Yuki stands at the corner near the entrance of the practice hall. On stage is Guest Chief Conductor Jacques Soleil Jr. and his orchestra. The mass of musicians play a song. They're all men!</narration>
		<line id="1000" speaker="jj" voicelang="ja">Louder, violins!</line>
		<line id="2000" speaker="jj" voicelang="ja">Louder!</line>
		<line id="3000" speaker="jj" voicelang="ja">Sforzando, come on!</line>
		<line id="4000" speaker="jj" voicelang="ja">Push it!</line>
		<narration>JJ breaks his stick over the stand. He points his hand at every single member of the orchestra.</narration>
		<line id="5000" speaker="jj" voicelang="ja">I didn't hire an all-male orchestra to play like a bunch of girls,</line>
		<line id="6000" speaker="jj" voicelang="ja">Nor did I hire you so that after work I could diddle your naughty bits!</line>
		<line id="7000" speaker="jj" voicelang="ja">Violin section, play like you have a pair.</line>
		<line id="8000" speaker="jj" voicelang="ja">This piece requires vigor!</line>
		<line id="9000" speaker="jj" voicelang="ja">That's why I got the hardest, best, and fastest, strongest players.</line>
		<line id="10000" speaker="jj" voicelang="ja">And coincidentally, none of you are women,</line>
		<narration>Jacques spins to look behind him for a bit.</narration>
		<condition>
			<choice number="1">
				<narration>Yuki keeps her distance from the group. Hopefully, no-one sees her.</narration>
				<line id="11000" speaker="jj" voicelang="ja">Because women lack vigor!</line>
				<narration>A cellist points behind JJ, off to the distance.</narration>
				<line id="12000" speaker="cellist" voicelang="ja">There's a girl&#x2014;</line>
				<line id="13000" speaker="jj" voicelang="ja">And that's why you have to play well, bro!</line>
				<line id="14000" speaker="jj" voicelang="ja">No woman wants a man who sucks at his job.</line>
				<line id="15000" speaker="jj" voicelang="ja">Alas, A woman's will is man's last stand.</line>
				<line id="16000" speaker="jj" voicelang="ja">We are all missing that one warm, loving, caring woman.</line>
				<line id="17000" speaker="jj" voicelang="ja">All of us. Right? Anyway.</line>
				<line id="18000" speaker="jj" voicelang="ja">Tough it out! Play harder!</line>

				<narration>JJ sprints through the exit. Yuki picks up the half-stick.<comment>Get the Player to do this.</comment></narration>
				<line id="22000" speaker="yuki" voicelang="ja">You're all ungrateful bastards.</line>
				<line id="23000" speaker="yuki" voicelang="ja">Mr. Soleil is the pearl cast before us all.</line>
				<line id="24000" speaker="yuki" voicelang="ja">You have a strong, courageous man fostering your talents.</line>

		<narration>The men play with twice the vigor; none of it becomes Yuki's.<comment>Zoom in on Yuki's face. Close-up sudden shift to The Clan.</comment></narration>
